<p> Chapter 1: <p>
  
<p> The section titled “the cat ate my source code” was the most interesting section to me. I picked it for a few reasons. One of those was that the title caught my attention and I thought it was pretty funny. Mainly because it was a different take on “my dog ate my homework” and I just really like it okay? But what it talked about in the paragraphs I also thought was really important. Most people, and sometimes I do this too, blame other people for their mistakes, but most of the time I try to see how I can improve. This is not only for coding but in general. Taking responsibility in general for your mistakes may seem bad but will be better in the long run. </p>

<p> One thing I didn’t consider is providing solutions when taking responsibility. Of course, I knew this in general, but I guess I never really thought of it in the coding world. The section gives good tips to how to prepare to talk to your boss if this situation ever comes up. By asking yourself how they will respond or ask is a good way to get yourself in that mindset. Also getting someone else’s input on the subject can also help you think about the problem in a different way. But also try to avoid all excuses which can be hard sometimes but like I said before is better in the long run. Overall, I really like what this section had to say tip wise and it was just funny to talk about how a cat ate your source code. </p>
